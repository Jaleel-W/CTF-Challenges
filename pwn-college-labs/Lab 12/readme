Advanced network security lab covering firewall configuration, traffic monitoring, and packet filtering using iptables to control network access and communication.

🚀 Lab Overview
This repository contains solutions and documentation for CSCI 400 Lab 12, focusing on network security principles, firewall configuration, and traffic control using Linux iptables.

🔍 Challenge Categories
Network Monitoring - Traffic analysis and network observation

Firewall Configuration - Packet filtering and access control

Rule Management - Creating, ordering, and managing iptables rules

Traffic Control - Allowing/denying specific network communications

Chain Manipulation - Working with INPUT and OUTPUT chains

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
bash
# Basic firewall rules
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 31337 -j DROP
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 31337 -j DROP

# Specific host filtering
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -s 10.0.0.2 --dport 31337 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp -s 10.0.0.3 --dport 31337 -j DROP

# OUTPUT chain control
iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.2 --dport 31337 -j ACCEPT
iptables Mastery - Linux firewall configuration and management

Packet Filtering - Controlling network traffic based on various criteria

Rule Prioritization - Understanding rule order and chain processing

Network Access Control - Implementing security policies through filtering

Traffic Monitoring - Network observation and analysis techniques

Security Policy Implementation - Translating security requirements to firewall rules

📂 Challenge Solutions
Challenge	Focus Area	Key Techniques
Monitor 1	Network observation	Traffic monitoring
Monitor 2	Advanced monitoring	Deep packet analysis
Firewall 1	Basic filtering	Port-based blocking
Firewall 2	Host-based rules	Source IP filtering
Firewall 3	OUTPUT chain control	Egress traffic management
💻 Technical Implementation
Basic Firewall Configuration
bash
# Block all traffic on port 31337
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 31337 -j DROP
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 31337 -j DROP
Host-Based Access Control
bash
# Allow specific host, deny others
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -s 10.0.0.2 --dport 31337 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp -s 10.0.0.3 --dport 31337 -j DROP
Egress Traffic Control
bash
# Control outgoing connections
iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.2 --dport 31337 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 31337 -j DROP

# Verify rule configuration
iptables -L OUTPUT -n --line-numbers
🔐 Security Insights
Rule order matters - iptables processes rules sequentially

INPUT vs OUTPUT chains control incoming vs outgoing traffic

Specific rules should precede general rules for proper filtering

Port-based blocking is fundamental for service security

Host-based filtering enables granular access control

Egress filtering prevents unauthorized outbound connections

🎯 Key Techniques Mastered
Firewall Rule Creation: Using iptables to create custom filtering rules

Rule Order Management: Understanding and manipulating rule precedence

Chain Selection: Choosing between INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains

Traffic Specification: Filtering by protocol, port, source, and destination

Policy Verification: Testing and validating firewall configurations

Network Segmentation: Implementing security through network isolation

📝 Usage
bash
# Clone and explore firewall techniques
git clone https://github.com/username/csci400-lab12.git
cd csci400-lab12

# Review firewall configuration examples
cat solutions/basic_firewall.md
cat solutions/advanced_filtering.md
cat solutions/egress_control.md

# Practice iptables commands (use with caution)
sudo iptables -L  # List current rules
⚠️ Important Notes
Warning: iptables commands can disrupt network connectivity if misconfigured. Always test in controlled environments and have backup access methods.

bash
# Safe practice: backup current rules before modifications
sudo iptables-save > iptables-backup.rules

# Restore if needed
sudo iptables-restore < iptables-backup.rules
📚 Requirements
Linux environment with iptables

Root/sudo access for firewall configuration

Understanding of TCP/IP networking

Basic command-line proficiency
