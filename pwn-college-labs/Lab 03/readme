CSCI 400 - Lab 3: User Privilege Escalation & Authentication

This repository documents my work on CSCI 400 Lab 3, which focuses on Linux user management, privilege escalation techniques, and authentication system vulnerabilities. The lab explores fundamental system administration concepts through practical exercises in user switching, password security, and privilege management. Key challenges included using the su command to switch to both root and other user accounts with provided credentials, cracking password hashes from shadow files using John the Ripper to recover user passwords, and leveraging sudo privileges to access protected system files without authentication. Through these exercises, I gained hands-on experience with Linux authentication mechanisms, password security weaknesses, and various methods of privilege escalation that are essential for both system administration and security testing. The lab emphasized the importance of strong password policies, proper sudo configuration, and understanding how authentication systems can be compromised through both legitimate access and security vulnerabilities.

üöÄ Lab Overview
This repository contains solutions and documentation for CSCI 400 Lab 3, focusing on Linux user management and privilege escalation techniques.

üîç Core Challenges
Becoming root with su - Switching to root user with known credentials

Other users with su - Accessing specific user accounts via password authentication

Cracking passwords - Using John the Ripper to recover passwords from shadow files

Using sudo - Leveraging sudo privileges to access protected files

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
User Management - Switching between user accounts with su command

Password Cracking - Using John the Ripper to crack Linux password hashes

Privilege Escalation - Gaining elevated access through various methods

Linux Authentication - Understanding shadow files and password security

Sudo Configuration - Leveraging sudo rights for system access

üìÇ Challenge Solutions
Challenge	Method	Credentials/Tools
Becoming root with su	su command	Password: hack-the-planet
Other users with su	su zardus	Password: dont-hack-me
Cracking passwords	John the Ripper	Cracked password: aardvark
Using sudo	sudo cat /flag	Sudo policy configuration
üíª Command Examples
bash
# Switching to root user
su
# Password: hack-the-planet
cat /flag

# Switching to specific user
su zardus
# Password: dont-hack-me
/challenge/run

# Password cracking
john /challenge/shadow-lask
john --show /challenge/shadow-lask

# Using sudo privileges
sudo cat /flag
üîê Security Insights
Shadow files containing password hashes can be cracked with tools like John the Ripper

Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks

Sudo configurations can provide privileged access without password prompts

User switching is a common privilege escalation technique
