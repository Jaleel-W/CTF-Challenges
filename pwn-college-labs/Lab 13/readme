Advanced Linux system manipulation lab covering destructive operations, resource exhaustion attacks, and system recovery techniques in controlled environments.

🚀 Lab Overview
This repository contains solutions and documentation for CSCI 400 Lab 13, focusing on system resource management, destructive commands, and recovery procedures for critical Linux system scenarios.

🔍 Challenge Categories
Fork Bomb - Process exhaustion and system resource attacks

Disk-Space Doomsday - Storage exhaustion and cleanup procedures

rm -rf / - System destruction and recovery techniques

System Resilience - Understanding and mitigating destructive operations

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
bash
# Disk space exhaustion
yes > /home/hacker/fill_disk.txt

# Resource monitoring and cleanup
rm /home/hacker/fill_disk.txt

# System recovery procedures
/challenge/check
Resource Exhaustion - Intentionally consuming system resources

Disk Space Management - Understanding storage limits and quotas

Destructive Command Handling - Safe execution of dangerous operations

System Recovery - Restoring functionality after resource exhaustion

Process Management - Handling fork bombs and process limits

Quota Enforcement - Working within system-imposed limitations

📂 Challenge Solutions
Challenge	Focus Area	Key Techniques
The Fork Bomb	Process exhaustion	Fork bomb creation and mitigation
Disk-Space Doomsday	Storage exhaustion	Disk filling and cleanup
rm -rf /	System destruction	File system recovery
Life after rm -rf /	Post-destruction recovery	System restoration
💻 Technical Implementation
Disk Space Exhaustion
bash
# Fill disk until quota is reached
yes > /home/hacker/fill_disk.txt
# Output: yes: standard output: Disk quota exceeded

# Verify space exhaustion
/challenge/check

# Cleanup and restore
rm /home/hacker/fill_disk.txt
/challenge/check
Resource Management
bash
# Monitor disk usage
df -h /home/hacker

# Check process limits
ulimit -a

# Verify restoration
/challenge/check
🔐 Security Insights
Resource exhaustion is a common denial-of-service (DoS) attack vector

Disk quotas help mitigate storage-based attacks

Fork bombs can cripple systems by exhausting process tables

rm -rf / demonstrates the importance of backup strategies

System recovery procedures are critical for business continuity

Controlled environments allow safe exploration of destructive scenarios

⚠️ Critical Warnings
EXTREME CAUTION: The techniques in this lab are extremely dangerous and should only be practiced in controlled, isolated environments. Never execute these commands on production systems or personal machines.

bash
# DANGEROUS COMMANDS - DO NOT RUN ON REAL SYSTEMS
:(){ :|:& };:  # Fork bomb
rm -rf /       # System destruction
yes > file     # Disk exhaustion
🎯 Key Techniques Mastered
Controlled Destruction: Safely executing dangerous operations in isolated environments

Resource Monitoring: Tracking system resources and identifying exhaustion points

Recovery Procedures: Restoring system functionality after intentional damage

Quota Management: Working within and testing system-imposed limits

Process Control: Understanding and managing process creation and limits

System Resilience: Building awareness of system vulnerabilities and protections

📝 Usage
bash
# Clone and review destruction techniques (THEORETICAL ONLY)
git clone https://github.com/username/csci400-lab13.git
cd csci400-lab13

# Review controlled environment procedures
cat solutions/disk_exhaustion.md
cat solutions/recovery_procedures.md

# WARNING: These techniques are for educational purposes only
# and should only be practiced in specially designed environments
🛡️ Safety Protocols
This lab emphasizes:

Isolated Environments: All destructive operations occur in controlled VMs

Educational Context: Understanding threats to better defend against them

Recovery Focus: Emphasizing restoration and resilience

Ethical Boundaries: Clear distinction between educational and malicious use

📚 Requirements
Controlled, isolated Linux environment (VM/lab)

Understanding of Linux system administration

Basic command-line proficiency

Access to pwn.college platform for original challenges

CAUTION: Never practice these techniques outside designated environments
