💻 Technical Implementation
Basic Network Communication
bash
# Connect to TCP service
nc 10.0.0.2 31337

# Send data to service
echo "Hello, World!" | nc 10.0.0.2 31337

# Listen for incoming connections
nc -l -p 31337
Network Scanning
bash
# Basic port scan on /24 subnet
nmap -p 31337 10.0.0.0/24 -Pn --open

# Aggressive scan on larger subnet
nmap -p 31337 10.0.0.0/18 -n -Pn --open -T5 --min-rate 5000 --max-retries 0

# Connect to discovered services
nc -nv 10.0.0.224 31337
nc -nv 10.0.170.2 31337
Advanced Nmap Techniques
bash
# Greppable output for automation
nmap -p 31337 10.0.0.0/18 -oG - | grep '/open/'

# Optimized scanning parameters
-T5          # Timing template (insane speed)
--min-rate 5000  # Minimum packets per second
--max-retries 0  # No retransmissions for speed
-Pn          # No host discovery (treat all hosts as up)
