# 🛡️ AI Security Lab: Adversarial Attack & Defense Simulation

> A practical exploration of evasion attacks and defense strategies for image classification models, inspired by real-world AI security research.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents a lab exercise from **CSCI 400**, exploring how adversarial attacks can fool AI models and how to defend against them. The project includes:

- An attack scenario: **"The Wolf in the Sheep's Clothing"** — fooling a CNN into misclassifying a wolf as a sheep.
- A comprehensive defense strategy with short-, medium-, and long-term mitigations.
- Implementations of adversarial training, input sanitization, ensemble methods, and more.

## 🎯 Attack Scenario

**Objective:**  
Cause a high-accuracy CNN (e.g., trained on ImageNet) to misclassify a wolf image as a **sheep**.

**Method:**  
Evasion attack using adversarial examples — carefully perturbed inputs designed to deceive the model.

## 🛡️ Defense Strategies

### Immediate Response (0–24 hours)
- Collect evidence and logs
- Throttle affected endpoints
- Enable human-in-the-loop review
- Rate limiting and source blocking

### Short-Term Mitigations
- Runtime detection (input transformations, ensemble disagreement)
- Input sanitization (JPEG compression, noise addition)
- Temporary source blocking

### Medium-Term Remediation
- Adversarial training (PGD, FGSM)
- Ensemble models with cross-validation
- Randomized smoothing

### Long-Term Hardening
- Adversarial testing in CI/CD
- Permanent adversarial detection models
- Updated operational policies and robustness audits
